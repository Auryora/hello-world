Learning how to use GitHub.
I got a computer 2 months ago.  Since then I have completed KhanAcademy AP Computer Science, Computer Science, and most of the Computer Programming course.  I have been also backing up my learning with w3schools and freecodecamp as well as other sites.  
Today is my attempt to learn GitHub and Visual Studio Codes by going through their tutorials.
